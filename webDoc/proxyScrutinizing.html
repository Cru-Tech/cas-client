		<h1>Scrutinizing Proxy Chains</h1>
		<p>This Java CAS client alpha distribution includes a ProxyChainScrutinizerFilter that is perhaps worth some discussion.</p>
		<p>On the CAS discussion list (cas at tp.its.yale.edu), Bill Dimmick wrote expressing a desire to consider more than just
			the immediately previous entry in the CAS proxy chain in determining whether to accept authentication proxied through some
			chain of services to a (presumably back-end) application/service.</p>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>My (Andrew's) first inclination was to characterize the CAS client 2.0.11 behavior of allowing consideration of only the most previous entry in the proxy chain
			as a feature, rather than a bug.  I was convinced off-list that there is actually a use case for consideration of more than just the immediately previous entry in the chain.
			Suppose you have a CASified IMAP server, a CASified Java Servlet which translates IMAP data into friendly XML, and two Portals which
			wish to display a Recent Email portal channel.  The middle service (the Java Servlet) might want to accept proxied authentication for both Portals, since
			it serves up email to both for some users and it itself has no way of determining, let us say, whether for a particular user it will be able to obtain
			the email to vend to a particular requesting portal.  The backend IMAP server, however, might be configured to consider the full Proxy Chain
			in determining whether to authorize the proxied authentication -- perhaps administrator's email can only be viewed in an administrative Portal whereas
			a student Portal can proxy authentication to obtain students' email.</p>
		<h2>Implementation - How can a filter do this</h2>
		<p>How is it possible to accomplish the goal of discrimination among proxy chains in consideration of 
			not just the most previous service in the chain, without adding this functionality to the CASFilter itself?</p>
		<p>The Java casclient CASFilter 2.1.0 (release candidate) exposes the results of ticket validation as a CASReceipt.  The CASReceipt includes the 
			proxy chain as described in the CAS proxy ticket validation response.  This proxy chain is available to subsequent filters 
			and servlets in the request 
			processing chain.  In particular, it is available so that a subsequent filter can scrutinize the proxy chain to determine
			whether the request is authorized.</p>
		<h2>Implementation - Why use a Filter?</h2>
		<p>Why use a filter instead of hacking  or extending the CASFilter class?</p>
		<h3>Filters are deploy-time configuration friendly</h3>
		<p>Configuring restrictions on proxied authentication by means of mapping Filters provides
			declarative configuration, allowing more flexibility in accomodating configuration and policy adjustments.</p>
		<h3>Filters make available the full power of Java</h3>
		<p>While I have written a ProxyChainScrutinizingFilter that will accomodate a common use case of examining more than just the previous
			entry in the proxy chain, this approach is by no means limited to the meager Filter I have written.
			In general, one could write a Filter that considered the identity of the user whose authentication is proxied, 
			a database, the date and time, other session and request attributes, or anything else available in the context of a Servlet Container.
			And the full expressive power of the Java programming language is available to compose logic operating on the available data.
			Finally, a broad range of possible responses is available, including wrapping or redirecting requests or responses, opting out of the 
			filter chain and forwarding directly to a servlet to compose the response, throwing a custom exception, etc.</p>
		<p>Adding a Filter subsequent to the CASFilter in the request processing chain provides more flexibility.</p>
		<h3>Composable filters help keep each filter small</h3>
		<p>An approach of composing filters to produce the desired result allows each filter to remain smaller, simpler, and more testable.</p>
		<h3>Filters are just cool!</h3>
		<p>To some extent, it's an aesthetic: composing filters appeals more to me than does extending classes.</p>
		<h2>A utility Filter: ProxyChainScrutinizerFilter</h2>
		<h3>Deployment</h3>
		<p>The ProxyChainScrutinizerFilter should be mapped after the CASFilter as it requires the CASFilter's CASReceipt 
			to already be set as an attribute of the session in order for it to have anything to scrutinize.</p>
		<p>The Filter is configured by an initialization parameter named edu.yale.its.tp.cas.client.filter.authorizedProxyChains . 
			The Filter attempts to do some error checking of this parameter on initialization.</p>
		<p>In the simplest deployment, the value of the parameter can be a whitespace delimited list of authorized proxies in the one proxy chain you would like to authorize.</p>
		<p>The chain should be specified in the same order it is specified by CAS upon proxy ticket validation -- from most previous service in the proxy chain back through any intermediary services in order back to finally the
			service to which the user presented her original Service Ticket.</p>
		<p>To authorize multiple proxy chains, simply place a semicolon - being sure to leave whitespace both before and after the semicolon so it is not parsed as part of a URL in a chain -
			between successive authorized proxy chains.</p>
		<p>Service tickets have empty proxy chains.  If you do not specify the empty chain as authorized, service ticekts will not be authorized.  To authorize
			the empty service ticket chain, the easyist thing to do is lead your list of authorized proxies with a semicolon, which terminates the first (empty) list of authorized proxies.</p>
		<h3>Behavior</h3>
		<p>There are two behaviors of the Filter: passing the request through the filter chain, and sending the response error code FORBIDDEN.</p>
		<p>It will pass the request along the chain if and only if it retrieves from the Session a CASReceipt the Proxy Chain of which is among those
			the Filter is configured to authorize.  In all other cases it aborts the FilterChain and sends a FORBIDDEN.</p>
		<h3>More information</h3>
		<p>Please see the testcase sourcecode for code that exercises the Filter and demonstrates its behavior, and of course see the ProxyChainScrutinizerFilter code itself.</p>
		<h4>Contact information:</h4>
		<p>I hope this exposition of the potential of using successive, composable Filters to configure behavior and the accompanying concrete code
			will be interesting or useful to the CAS community.</p>
