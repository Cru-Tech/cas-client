		<h1>Proxy Load Balance</h1>
		<p>This sample application demonstrates the use of the ProxyEchoFilter to echo proxy granting tickets across
			loadbalanced uPortal instances.</p>
		<p>To use, put the casclient.jar into the lib directory, edit the web.xml, and manually issue a 
			proxy granting ticket id and iou to one of the clustered receptors.  The log files should report that it is echoed
			to all of them.</p>
